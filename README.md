DEM simulation of spherical particles released into a cube filled with calm water.
Simulation was last edited in 2005.

The objective of future modifications will be to created a fluidized bed simulation with a user interface.
In order to acheive that, the cubic container will have to be remodeled into a cylinder, and a perpetual upwards flow of the water must be generated.
